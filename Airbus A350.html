                <h3>Major Accidents and Incidents</h3>
                <p>The Airbus A350 has a strong safety record with no passenger fatalities. The single hull loss to date was the result of a runway collision.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Japan Airlines Flight 516 (January 2, 2024):</strong> An A350-900 collided with a Japan Coast Guard Dash 8 aircraft upon landing at Tokyo Haneda Airport. While the A350 was destroyed by fire, all 367 passengers and 12 crew members evacuated safely. Five of the six occupants on the Coast Guard aircraft were killed.</li>
                    <li><strong>British Airways (April 6, 2024):</strong> A ground collision occurred at London Heathrow Airport between a British Airways A350-1000 and a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 787. The investigation determined the cause to be the absence of wing walkers during the 787's pushback. Both aircraft sustained structural damage but were later returned to service.</li>
