                <h3>Major Accidents and Incidents</h3>
                <p>The Boeing 737 MAX has been involved in several significant incidents, most notably two fatal crashes that led to a worldwide grounding of the fleet.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lion Air Flight 610 (October 29, 2018):</strong> A 737 MAX 8 crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (March 10, 2019):</strong> A 737 MAX 8 crashed near Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, just minutes after takeoff, resulting in the deaths of all 157 passengers and crew.</li>
                    <li><strong>Worldwide Grounding (March 2019 - December 2020):</strong> Following the two crashes, which were linked to the aircraft's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), aviation authorities around the world grounded all 387 MAX aircraft. The grounding lasted for 20 months, becoming the longest in the history of a U.S. airliner.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 (January 5, 2024):</strong> A 737 MAX 9 experienced an explosive decompression after a door plug separated from the fuselage shortly after takeoff from Portland, Oregon. The aircraft returned safely with no serious injuries reported. This incident led to a temporary grounding of certain MAX 9 aircraft for inspections.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="info-column">
                <h3>Variants & Airline Use</h3>
                <p>The 737 MAX is the fourth generation of the Boeing 737 and includes four primary models, along with a high-density version of the MAX 8.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>737 MAX 7:</strong> The smallest variant, designed to replace the 737-700.</li>
                    <li><strong>737 MAX 8:</strong> The most popular variant, offering a balance of range and capacity. A high-density version, the **MAX 8200**, is also produced.</li>
                    <li><strong>737 MAX 9:</strong> A stretched version of the MAX 8, replacing the 737-900.</li>
                    <li><strong>737 MAX 10:</strong> The largest variant in the family, designed to compete with the Airbus A321neo.</li>
                    <li><strong>Note:</strong> As of late 2025, the MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants are still awaiting FAA certification.</li>
